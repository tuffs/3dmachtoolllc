# 3D MACHINE AND TOOL LLC
The official website will now be developed using NextJS and TailwindCSS for the best experience.
We will continue to use an ORM to interface with a PostgreSQL database. But, for free with Neon.tech.
Prisma will then be used as the ORM to interface between our app and SaaS solution for database activity.

# DESIGN PROCESS NOTES AND IMPORTANT COMMITS
[main 75e7ff4] Updates to design and amplify our service displays on the homepage. Added framer-motion to the hover state of the images used. Added in description to the service data model. Have not refactored for mobile view for the following: Navigation, Logo Mark, and Services. I will complete all of the design refactors after the base desktop and tablet view is completed. I want to ensure that I spend enough time on this portion of the website to 'get it right' as it is the first thing our prospective customer will engage with. Need to add more interactivity on the hover state to give our users a clear call to action that engages their desire to learn more. Need to become a bit more post-modern industrial. Background needs either a topographic levels outline like a relief map for something, maybe a machined object in some way OR needs a designers grid area. But both must fade out and be subtle. Having one or the other interact with the mouse on a hover and scroll state would be interesting. I need to talk about and describe the actions desired in more detail as I iterate over this base design.
